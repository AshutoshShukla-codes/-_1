<h1>IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION ðŸŒ¿</h1>
<p>Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements.</p>  
<p>To train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.</p>
<h1>About Data :</h1>
<p>The dataset has mainly 4 features : SepalLengthCm,	SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm and	PetalWidthCm </p>

<h1>Model :</h1>
<p>I have selected the <b>Logistic Regression model</b> as it is giving the perfect results</p>
<p><b>Logistic Regression :</b>It is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.</p>
<p><b>Sigmoid function</b>is the mathematical function behind the Logistic Regression algorithm : sig(z) = 1/1+e^(-z)</p>
